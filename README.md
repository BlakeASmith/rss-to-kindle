# rss-to-kindle

Forward articles from multiple RSS feeds to your Kindle via a Kindle email address. 

`to-kindle` aggregates articles into a single `.mobi` ebook, so your library page doesn't get bombarded with 100s of documents.

There are plenty of existing solutions including [sendtoreader](https://sendtoreader.com/), [rss-to-kindle](https://github.com/manchiyiu/rss-to-kindle), and various automations using [Zapier](https://zapier.com/) or [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/). However I wanted more control over how the content is aggregated (and I don't want to pay for a subscription).
